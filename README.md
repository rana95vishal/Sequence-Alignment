# Sequence-Alignment
An implementation of some basic sequence alignment algorithms (Needleman-Wunsch and Smith Waterman)

The .ipynb file contains implementation of Global alignment (Needleman-Wunsch), Fitted alignment and Local alignment (Smith-Waterman) along with some simple test cases to show how the algorithms perform.
